# Java-Threading-Matrix-Multiplication

## Goal

Our goal here is to understand Java threading in-depth.

## How it works

In this assignment, I am implementing matrix multiplication with Java threading. Here, computations will be done by different threads and this will reduce the time of completing the operation. This assignment was a part of our OOP sessional course of CSE, BUET.
